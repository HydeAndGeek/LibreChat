# AutoGen Integration

The AutoGen integration provides a way to create teams of AI agents that can collaborate to solve complex tasks. Each agent has a specific role and expertise, and they can communicate with each other to break down and solve problems.

## Components

### Agents

Agents are specialized AI assistants with defined roles and capabilities. The system comes with several default agents:

- **Coder**: Expert software engineer for writing and reviewing code
- **Reviewer**: Code reviewer focused on quality and best practices
- **Architect**: System designer for architectural decisions
- **Tester**: QA engineer for testing and quality assurance

### Teams

Teams are collections of agents that work together on tasks. A team configuration includes:

- List of agents with their roles and system messages
- Set of tasks to accomplish
- Communication patterns between agents

### Tasks

Tasks are structured workflows that agents execute. Each task has:

- An initiator agent who starts the task
- A sequence of steps with prompts
- Optional context and parameters

## API Endpoints

### Agent Management

```http
# Initialize AutoGen service
GET /api/autogen/init

# Create a new agent
POST /api/autogen/agents
{
  "name": "custom-agent",
  "role": "Custom Role",
  "systemMessage": "Your role-specific instructions"
}

# Get default agent configurations
GET /api/autogen/agents/default

# Get current agent status
GET /api/autogen/agents/status
```

### Team Management

```http
# Create a new team
POST /api/autogen/teams
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "coder",
      "role": "Software Engineer",
      "systemMessage": "..."
    },
    {
      "name": "reviewer",
      "role": "Code Reviewer",
      "systemMessage": "..."
    }
  ],
  "tasks": []
}
```

### Task Management

```http
# Execute a task
POST /api/autogen/tasks/execute
{
  "teamConfig": {
    "agents": [...],
    "tasks": []
  },
  "task": {
    "initiator": "coder",
    "steps": [
      {
        "prompt": "Write a function that..."
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Get task templates
GET /api/autogen/tasks/templates
```

## Example Usage

1. Initialize the service:
```javascript
await fetch('/api/autogen/init');
```

2. Create a team with default agents:
```javascript
const team = await fetch('/api/autogen/teams', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    agents: [
      defaultAgents.coder,
      defaultAgents.reviewer
    ],
    tasks: []
  })
});
```

3. Execute a code review task:
```javascript
const result = await fetch('/api/autogen/tasks/execute', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    teamConfig: team,
    task: {
      initiator: 'reviewer',
      steps: [
        {
          prompt: `Review this code:\n${code}`
        },
        {
          prompt: 'Summarize your findings'
        }
      ]
    }
  })
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**
   - Give agents clear, focused roles
   - Provide detailed system messages
   - Avoid overlapping responsibilities

2. **Team Composition**
   - Include agents with complementary skills
   - Keep teams small and focused
   - Define clear communication patterns

3. **Task Structure**
   - Break complex tasks into clear steps
   - Provide sufficient context
   - Use appropriate templates

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handle API errors gracefully
   - Validate inputs before sending
   - Monitor agent interactions

## Security Considerations

1. All endpoints require JWT authentication
2. Validate and sanitize all inputs
3. Monitor and rate limit API usage
4. Secure sensitive configuration data
