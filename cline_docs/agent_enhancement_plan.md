# Agent Enhancement Plan

## Current System (Keep)
1. MetaGPT Core Team
   - Product Manager: Requirements & planning
   - Architect: System design
   - Engineer: Implementation
   - QA Engineer: Testing & quality

2. Swarm Management
   - Phase coordination
   - Agent status tracking
   - Progress monitoring
   - Output management

## AutoGen Integration
1. Development Support
   - Code Generation Team
     * Code Writer: Implements features
     * Code Reviewer: Checks quality
     * Documentation Writer: Updates docs
     * Test Writer: Creates test cases

2. Technical Planning Team
   - Architecture Advisor: Design decisions
   - Security Expert: Security review
   - Performance Analyst: Optimization
   - Integration Specialist: System connections

3. Problem-Solving Team
   - Research Agent: Investigates solutions
   - Debug Agent: Resolves issues
   - Optimization Agent: Improves code
   - Review Agent: Validates solutions

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Development Workflow
```
MetaGPT Team (High-level) → AutoGen Team (Implementation) → MetaGPT QA (Validation)

1. MetaGPT PM creates requirements
2. AutoGen team implements features
3. MetaGPT QA validates results
```

### 2. Communication Flow
```
LibreChat
├── MetaGPT Orchestration
│   └── Project phases
│       └── Team coordination
└── AutoGen Group Chats
    └── Implementation details
        └── Technical discussions
```

### 3. Tool Integration
1. Development Tools
   - VSCode for coding
   - Git for version control
   - Railway for deployment

2. AI Services
   - OpenAI API
   - Claude API
   - Gemini API
   - Perplexity API

3. Monitoring
   - LibreChat Swarm UI
   - MetaGPT Dashboard
   - AutoGen Chat Logs
