# OK-Dog UI Architecture

## Recommendation
Create a separate frontend application rather than extending LibreChat's UI:

### Reasoning
1. Different Core Purpose
   - LibreChat: AI chat interface
   - OK-Dog: Business management platform

2. Technical Considerations
   - LibreChat has chat-specific complexity
   - OK-Dog needs business-focused features
   - Simpler state management possible
   - Better performance optimization

3. Development Efficiency
   - Faster development
   - Easier maintenance
   - Better testing
   - Cleaner code

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. Technology Stack
- React (Next.js)
  * Better SEO
  * Improved performance
  * Built-in API routes
  * Server-side rendering

- UI Framework
  * Tailwind CSS (keep from LibreChat)
  * Headless UI components
  * Custom design system

- State Management
  * React Query for API data
  * Zustand for UI state
  * React Context for themes
